Welcome to the official repository for custom Yu-Gi-Oh! cards designed by **Links-Glitch**.

These cards are created using **DataEditorX** and **Lua scripting** for use with the **EDOPro** simulator (formerly YGOPro).

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Install These Cards

To use these custom cards in your EDOPro client, follow these simple steps.

### 1. Download the Files

You can clone this repository or simply download the necessary files:

* **Database Data:** `cards.cdb` (Contains the card's name, stats, and effect text).
* **Script Logic:** The `script/` folder (Contains the `55500001.lua` file, which makes the effect work).
* **Card Image (Optional):** The `pics/` folder (Contains the card's artwork image).

### 2. Move the Files into EDOPro

Navigate to your main **EDOPro installation folder** (e.g., `C:/Program Files/EDOPro/`).

| File Type | Source Folder | EDOPro Destination | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Database** | `cards.cdb` | Place directly into the **`deck`** folder | This file contains the card's data. |
| **Script** | `script/55500001.lua` | Place into the **`script`** folder | This file enables the card's effects. |
| **Image** | `pics/55500001.png` | Place into the **`pics/card/`** folder | Recommended for visual quality. |

### 3. Restart EDOPro

Close and reopen EDOPro. You should now be able to find **Greed Lizard** in the deck editor by searching for its name or Card ID (`55500001`).
